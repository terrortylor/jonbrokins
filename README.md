## Installation

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here
Requires curses, see this page for details on dependencies: [ruby/curses](https://github.com/ruby/curses)

NOTE: On Ubuntu the `libncurses5-dev` package was required. OSX worked as is.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
